                            not specified, by manual construction of an Endpoints
                            object or EndpointSlice objects. If clusterIP is "None",
                            no virtual IP is allocated and the endpoints are published
                            as a set of endpoints rather than a virtual IP. "NodePort"
                            builds on ClusterIP and allocates a port on every node
                            which routes to the same endpoints as the clusterIP. "LoadBalancer"
                            builds on NodePort and creates an external load-balancer
                            (if supported in the current cloud) which routes to the
                            same endpoints as the clusterIP. "ExternalName" aliases
                            this service to the specified externalName. Several other
                            fields do not apply to ExternalName services. More info:

                            a "headless service" (no virtual IP), which is useful
                            when direct endpoint connections are preferred and proxying
                            is not required.  Only applies to types ClusterIP, NodePort,
