# VMRule

The `VMRule` CRD declaratively defines a desired Prometheus rule to be consumed by one or more VMAlert instances.

Alerts and recording rules can be saved and applied as YAML files, and dynamically loaded without requiring any restart.

## Specification

You can see the full actual specification of the `VMRule` resource in
the [API docs -> VMRule](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/operator/api.html#vmrule).
