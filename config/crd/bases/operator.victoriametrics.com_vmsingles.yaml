                        setting this field is for a StatefulSet's Headless Service
                        to propagate SRV DNS records for its Pods for the purpose
                        of peer discovery. The Kubernetes controllers that generate
                        Endpoints and EndpointSlice resources for Services interpret
                        this to mean that all endpoints are considered "ready" even
                        if the Pods themselves are not. Agents which consume only
                        Kubernetes generated endpoints through the Endpoints or EndpointSlice
                        resources can safely assume this behavior.
