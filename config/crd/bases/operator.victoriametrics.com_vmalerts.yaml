                        is assumed that a load balancer implementation is watching

                        to propagate SRV DNS records for its Pods for the purpose
                        of peer discovery. The Kubernetes controllers that generate

                        Kubernetes generated endpoints through the Endpoints or EndpointSlice
                        resources can safely assume this behavior.

                    time for your process. If this value is nil, the pod's terminationGracePeriodSeconds
                    will be used. Otherwise, this value overrides the value provided
                    by the pod spec. Value must be non-negative integer. The value
                    zero indicates stop immediately via the kill signal (no opportunity
                    to shut down). This is an alpha field and requires enabling ProbeTerminationGracePeriod
                    feature gate.

                      is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can tolerate
