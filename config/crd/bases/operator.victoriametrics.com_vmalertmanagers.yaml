                              tracks the capacity allocated to a PVC. It may be larger
                              than the actual capacity when a volume expansion operation
                              is requested. For storage quota, the larger value from
                              allocatedResources and PVC.spec.resources is used. If

                              is used for quota calculation. If a volume expansion
