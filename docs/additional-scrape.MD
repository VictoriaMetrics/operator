# Additional Scrape Configuration

AdditionalScrapeConfigs allows specifying a key of a Secret containing
additional Prometheus scrape configurations. Scrape configurations specified
are appended to the configurations generated by the Prometheus Operator.

Job configurations specified must have the form as specified in the official
[Prometheus documentation](
https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#scrape_config).
As scrape configs are appended, the user is responsible to make sure it is
valid. 

## Creating an additional configuration

First, you will need to create the additional configuration.
Below we are making a simple "prometheus" config.  Name this
`prometheus-additional.yaml` or something similar.

```yaml
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: additional-scrape-configs
stringData:
  prometheus-additional.yaml: |
    - job_name: "prometheus"
      static_configs:
      - targets: ["localhost:9090"]
EOF
```

Finally, reference this additional configuration in your `vmagent.yaml` CRD.

```yaml
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: operator.victoriametrics.com/v1beta1
kind: VMAgent
metadata:
  name: example-vmagent
spec:
  serviceMonitorSelector: {}
  replicas: 1
  serviceAccountName: vmagent
  additionalScrapeConfigs:
    name: additional-scrape-configs
    key: prometheus-additional.yaml
  remoteWrite:
    - url: "http://vmagent-example-vmsingle.default.svc:8429/api/v1/write"
EOF
```

NOTE: Use only one secret for ALL additional scrape configurations.
